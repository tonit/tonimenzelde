  Dein Blick durch die Entwicklerbrille

<p>
  I'm a developer living in <a href="#">Los Angeles, CA</a>. I co-founded HashiCorp.
</p>
<p>
I was part of the initial engineering team behind most of our products, such as Vagrant, Packer, Consul, Terraform, Vault, Nomad, Waypoint, and more. I don't work directly on most of those projects anymore. I was CEO for ~4 years, CTO for ~5 years, and then transitioned to being an individual contributor.
</p>
<p>
I fly airplanes. ✈️ I'm an FAA licensed private pilot with an instrument rating (PPL ASEL IR). I currently fly a Cirrus SR22T. I frequently share pictures of my flights. Aviation overlaps with my passion for programming and I routinely work on aviation software for fun.
